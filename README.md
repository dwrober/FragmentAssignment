FragmentAssignment
==================

Android fragment assignment

This project is a simple android application that uses 2 fragments, one representing the parent view and the second representing the child view.  I was supposed to think of a parent child example that was not a copy of an online example (ex: headline/article) so I choose to do a simple even/odd numbers example.  The main fragment is the type of number, and the child is an example of 50 of those numbers.
